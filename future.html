	<p>Some places that I have worked for and with in the past include 
		<a href="https://www.coachingdetroitforward.org/">Coaching Detroit Forward</a>,
		a nonprofit based in Detroit that aims to provide journalism and photography camps to high
		school students, as well as 
		<a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/lswa">Lloyd Scholars for Writing and the Arts</a>. LSWA is 
		a living-learning community that I was a part of, and has shaped my creative direction. 
		While they have shaped me to who I am today, I would love to go back and help in 
		anyway I can again.
